# Python Projects Repository

## About this Repository

Welcome to my Python Projects repository! Here, you will find a collection of small yet powerful Python projects that demonstrate my growing proficiency in Python programming. These projects showcase my ability to handle problem-solving, build efficient algorithms, and implement creative solutions in Python.

### Projects Included:
1. **Snake-Water-Gun Game**  
   A Python-based implementation of the classic Snake-Water-Gun game (similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors). This project involves user interaction, random choice generation, and simple game logic to determine the winner.

   **Skills Demonstrated**: 
   - Conditional logic
   - User input handling
   - Random module for choice selection

2. **The Perfect Guess**  
   A fun guessing game where the program randomly selects a number and the player must guess it in as few tries as possible. The game includes user-friendly hints and a scoring system to track progress.

   **Skills Demonstrated**: 
   - Random number generation
   - Looping and condition handling
   - User-friendly interaction with scorekeeping

3. **Password Generator**  
   A secure password generator that creates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria (length, inclusion of symbols, numbers, etc.). This project focuses on string manipulation and randomness.

   **Skills Demonstrated**: 
   - String manipulation and formatting
   - List comprehensions for efficiency
   - Use of `random` module to generate secure passwords
